Input
The first line of the input consists of a single integer K giving the number of test cases. Each test
case consist on an integer n giving the number of turtles in the stack. The next n lines specify the
original ordering of the turtle stack. Each of the lines contains the name of a turtle, starting with the
turtle on the top of the stack and working down to the turtle at the bottom of the stack. Turtles have
unique names, each of which is a string of no more than eighty characters drawn from a character set
consisting of the alphanumeric characters, the space character and the period (‘.’). The next n lines
in the input gives the desired ordering of the stack, once again by naming turtles from top to bottom.
Each test case consists of exactly 2n + 1 lines in total. The number of turtles (n) will be less than or
equal to two hundred.
